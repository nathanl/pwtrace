## Guidelines

- Start by reading `README.md` to understand the project
- For every update:
  - Add or update automated tests as needed and ensure that they pass
  - Update docs in `README.md`
  - Update help text (`pwtrace --help` and pwtrace <command> --help`)
  - Update `CHANGELOG.md` (add changes to an "Unreleased" section)
